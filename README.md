# Data-Structure with TypeScript

As front-end and front-end developer are scaling, voicing and forcing their opinion to be heard the expertise also need to be enhanced and well equipped. So, just worrying about never-ending new javascript library we should focus on the building blocks of programming **Data Structure and Algorithms**. The backend layer is becoming thiner and thiner day by day resulting more data handling and business logic in the front-end. 

So Basically in this post we will proceed with the below data structures:

* [Stack](stack.md)
* Queue
* Linked List
* Tree
* Hash Table
* Graphs

{% hint style="info" %}
currently this series will be based on **typescript** with generics support. later on I may add the implementation with other popular languages front-end developers are adopting like: **python**, **golang** etc.
{% endhint %}
